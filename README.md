# Make-Access-Point
This is a shell script for making a access Point by executing a shell script. 

Originally made for arch linux on a raspberry pi 3.

It will first look for a ethernet connection and then a wlan connection.
If the internal wlan is in use, please add a wifi USB dongle.
Otherwise the AP will not be made.
